Suggest some theming variables and their values for an inhouse design system for frontend. Our design statement is "Crisp modern style with thin edge, giving an efficient but also hip and inclusive vibe."

----

Searching for: theming variables design system

Sure, I can help you with that. Based on the web search results, some common theming variables for a design system are color, typography, spacing, and breakpoints²³⁴. These variables can be defined using Sass or CSS and can be overridden to customize the design system according to your design statement²⁴.

For example, you could define some variables like this:

$color-primary: #007bff; // a crisp blue color
$color-secondary: #f0f0f0; // a light gray color
$color-accent: #ff9900; // a hip orange color
$font-family-base: "Roboto", sans-serif; // a modern font
$font-size-base: 1rem; // a thin font size
$spacing-base: 0.5rem; // a small spacing unit
$breakpoint-sm: 576px; // a breakpoint for small screens

These are just some suggestions based on the web search results and your design statement. You can adjust them according to your preferences and needs.

Show me an example of applying these variables to a design element (say, a card). Include react code example. I would also like to extend the design system to include visual elements of shadows and padding.

----

Searching for: design system card component react

Okay, here is an example of applying the variables to a card component using React. I used the Material UI library¹ as a reference, but you can use any other library or framework you prefer. I also added some variables for shadows and padding as you requested.

```jsx
// Import React and Material UI components
import React from 'react';
import { Card, CardActionArea, CardActions, CardContent, CardMedia, Button, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';

// Define the theming variables
const theme = {
  colorPrimary: '#007bff', // a crisp blue color
  colorSecondary: '#f0f0f0', // a light gray color
  colorAccent: '#ff9900', // a hip orange color
  fontFamilyBase: '"Roboto", sans-serif', // a modern font
  fontSizeBase: '1rem', // a thin font size
  spacingBase: '0.5rem', // a small spacing unit
  breakpointSm: '576px', // a breakpoint for small screens
  boxShadowBase: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)', // a subtle shadow
  boxShadowHover: '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)', // a stronger shadow on hover
  paddingBase: '1rem', // a base padding for card content
};

// Create a custom card component using the theming variables
const CustomCard = ({ image, title, text }) => {
  return (
    <Card style={{ width: '18rem', boxShadow: theme.boxShadowBase }}>
      <CardActionArea>
        <CardMedia style={{ height: '10rem' }} image={image} title={title} />
        <CardContent style={{ padding: theme.paddingBase }}>
          <Typography gutterBottom variant="h5" component="h2" style={{ fontFamily: theme.fontFamilyBase }}>
            {title}
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body2" color="textSecondary" component="p" style={{ fontFamily: theme.fontFamilyBase }}>
            {text}
          </Typography>
        </CardContent>
      </CardActionArea>
      <CardActions style={{ padding: theme.paddingBase }}>
        <Button size="small" color="primary" style={{ color: theme.colorPrimary }}>
          Learn More
        </Button>
      </CardActions>
    </Card>
  );
};

// Render the custom card component with some sample data
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', height: '100vh' }}>
      <CustomCard

        text="This is a sample card component using React and Material UI with custom theming variables."
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

Modify the example above to use styled-components.

----

Searching for: styled-components react

Sure, here is the modified example using styled-components¹. I used the same theming variables as before, but I moved them to a separate file called theme.js. I also used the styled-components/macro import path to enable the Babel plugin features without extra configuration².

theme.js
```js
// Define the theming variables
export const theme = {
  colorPrimary: '#007bff', // a crisp blue color
  colorSecondary: '#f0f0f0', // a light gray color
  colorAccent: '#ff9900', // a hip orange color
  fontFamilyBase: '"Roboto", sans-serif', // a modern font
  fontSizeBase: '1rem', // a thin font size
  spacingBase: '0.5rem', // a small spacing unit
  breakpointSm: '576px', // a breakpoint for small screens
  boxShadowBase: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)', // a subtle shadow
  boxShadowHover: '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)', // a stronger shadow on hover
  paddingBase: '1rem', // a base padding for card content
};
```

App.js
```jsx
// Import React and styled-components
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components/macro';

// Import the theming variables
import { theme } from './theme';

// Create a custom card component using the theming variables and styled-components
const CustomCard = styled(Card)`
  width: 18rem;
  box-shadow: ${theme.boxShadowBase};
`;

const CustomCardActionArea = styled(CardActionArea)`
  &:hover {
    box-shadow: ${theme.boxShadowHover};
  }
`;

const CustomCardMedia = styled(CardMedia)`
  height: 10rem;
`;

const CustomCardContent = styled(CardContent)`
  padding: ${theme.paddingBase};
`;

const CustomCardTitle = styled(Typography).attrs({
  gutterBottom: true,
  variant: 'h5',
  component: 'h2',
})`
  font-family: ${theme.fontFamilyBase};
`;

const CustomCardText = styled(Typography).attrs({
  variant: 'body2',
  color: 'textSecondary',
  component: 'p',
})`
  font-family: ${theme.fontFamilyBase};
`;

const CustomCardActions = styled(CardActions)`
  padding: ${theme.paddingBase};
`;

const CustomButton = styled(Button).attrs({
  size: 'small',
})`
  color: ${theme.colorPrimary};

Further modify the example to use Bulma instead of Material UI library.

----

Searching for: bulma react card

Okay, here is the modified example using Bulma¹ instead of Material UI. I used the react-bulma-components library² to integrate Bulma with React. I also used the same theming variables as before, but I had to use inline styles to apply them to the Bulma components.

theme.js
```js
// Define the theming variables
export const theme = {
  colorPrimary: '#007bff', // a crisp blue color
  colorSecondary: '#f0f0f0', // a light gray color
  colorAccent: '#ff9900', // a hip orange color
  fontFamilyBase: '"Roboto", sans-serif', // a modern font
  fontSizeBase: '1rem', // a thin font size
  spacingBase: '0.5rem', // a small spacing unit
  breakpointSm: '576px', // a breakpoint for small screens
  boxShadowBase: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)', // a subtle shadow
  boxShadowHover: '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)', // a stronger shadow on hover
  paddingBase: '1rem', // a base padding for card content
};
```

App.js
```jsx
// Import React and Bulma components
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Content, Heading, Image } from 'react-bulma-components';

// Import the theming variables
import { theme } from './theme';

// Create a custom card component using the theming variables and Bulma components
const CustomCard = ({ image, title, text }) => {
  return (
    <Card style={{ width: '18rem', boxShadow: theme.boxShadowBase }}>
      <Card.Image size="4by3" src={image} />
      <Card.Content>
        <Content>
          <Heading size={4} style={{ fontFamily: theme.fontFamilyBase }}>
            {title}
          </Heading>
          <p style={{ fontFamily: theme.fontFamilyBase }}>{text}</p>
        </Content>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card>
  );
};

// Render the custom card component with some sample data
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center', height: '100vh' }}>
      <CustomCard
        image="https://source.unsplash.com/random"
        title="Sample Card"
        text="This is a sample card component using React and Bulma with custom theming variables."
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

Can you draw a picture of how the example card (bulma one) would look like?

----

Sure, here is a rough sketch of how the example card would look like:

```
+----------------------+
|                      |
|       IMAGE          |
|                      |

|                      |
| This is a sample...  |
|                      |
+----------------------+
```

----

Can you refactor the Bulma example code to use the BEM methodology?

----

Searching for: BEM methodology

Sure, here is the refactored example using the BEM methodology¹. I used the same theming variables as before, but I had to create a separate CSS file to define the BEM classes. I also used the className property to apply the classes to the Bulma components.

theme.js
```js
// Define the theming variables
export const theme = {
  colorPrimary: '#007bff', // a crisp blue color
  colorSecondary: '#f0f0f0', // a light gray color
  colorAccent: '#ff9900', // a hip orange color
  fontFamilyBase: '"Roboto", sans-serif', // a modern font
  fontSizeBase: '1rem', // a thin font size
  spacingBase: '0.5rem', // a small spacing unit
  breakpointSm: '576px', // a breakpoint for small screens
  boxShadowBase: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)', // a subtle shadow
  boxShadowHover: '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)', // a stronger shadow on hover
  paddingBase: '1rem', // a base padding for card content
};
```

App.css
```css
/* Define the BEM classes using the theming variables */
.card {
  width: 18rem;
  box-shadow: var(--box-shadow-base);
}

.card__image {
  height: 10rem;
}

.card__content {
  padding: var(--padding-base);
}

.card__title {
  font-family: var(--font-family-base);
}

.card__text {
  font-family: var(--font-family-base);
}

/* Define custom CSS variables for the theming variables */
:root {
  --color-primary: #007bff;
  --color-secondary: #f0f0f0;
  --color-accent: #ff9900;
  --font-family-base: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  --font-size-base: 1rem;
  --spacing-base: 0.5rem;
  --breakpoint-sm: 576px;
  --box-shadow-base: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --box-shadow-hover: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  --padding-base: 1rem;
}
```

App.js
```jsx
// Import React and Bulma components
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Content, Heading, Image } from 'react-bulma-components';

// Import the BEM classes
import './App.css';

// Create a custom card component using the BEM classes and Bulma components
const CustomCard = ({ image, title, text }) => {
  return (
    <Card className="card">

      <Card.Content className="card__content">

Show me how to test or view this component using the storyboard library.

----

Searching for: storybook react

Sure, here is how you can test or view the component using the Storybook library¹. I followed the steps from the official documentation² to install and configure Storybook for React.

First, you need to install Storybook as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @storybook/react
```

Then, you need to add some scripts to your package.json file to run and build Storybook:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006",
    "build-storybook": "build-storybook"
  }
}
```

Next, you need to create a .storybook folder in your project root and add a main.js file inside it. This file tells Storybook where to find your stories:

```js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.js'],
};
```

A story is a function that renders a component in a specific state. You can create stories for your custom card component by adding a CustomCard.stories.js file next to your App.js file:

```js
// Import React and Bulma components
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Content, Heading, Image } from 'react-bulma-components';

// Import the BEM classes
import './App.css';

// Import the theming variables
import { theme } from './theme';

// Create a custom card component using the BEM classes and Bulma components
const CustomCard = ({ image, title, text }) => {
  return (
    <Card className="card">
      <Card.Image className="card__image" src={image} />
      <Card.Content className="card__content">
        <Content>
          <Heading className="card__title" size={4}>
            {title}
          </Heading>
          <p className="card__text">{text}</p>
        </Content>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card>
  );
};

// Export the component name as default
export default {
  title: 'CustomCard',
  component: CustomCard,
};

// Export some stories for the component with different props
export const Default = () => (
  <CustomCard
    image="https://source.unsplash.com/random"
    title="Default Card"
    text="This is a default card with no custom props."
  />
);

export const Large = () => (
  <CustomCard
    image="https://source.unsplash.com/random"
    title="Large Card"
    text="This is a large card with a custom style prop."
    style={{ width: '24rem' }}
  />
);

export const Small = () => (
  <CustomCard
    image="https://source.unsplash.com/random"
    title="Small Card"
    text="This is a small card with a custom style prop."
    style={{ width: '12rem' }}
  />
);
```

Finally, you can run Storybook by running npm run storybook in your terminal. This will open a browser window where you can see your component rendered in different states according to your stories. You can also use various addons and tools to enhance your Storybook experience.

Can you show me how to write tests for my stories?

----

Searching for: storybook testing

Sure, here is how you can write tests for your stories using Storybook Interaction Testing¹. I followed the steps from the official documentation² to install and configure the test runner and assertion library.

First, you need to install the @storybook/testing-react package as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @storybook/testing-react
```

Then, you need to add a script to your package.json file to run the test runner:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:stories": "sb test"
  }
}
```

Next, you need to add some assertions to your stories using the expect function from @storybook/testing-react. This function allows you to check various properties of your component, such as text content, attributes, styles, etc. You can also use Testing Library queries to select elements from your component.

For example, you could add some assertions to your CustomCard.stories.js file like this:

```js
// Import React and Bulma components
import React from 'react';
import { Card, Content, Heading, Image } from 'react-bulma-components';

// Import the BEM classes
import './App.css';

// Import the theming variables
import { theme } from './theme';

// Import the expect function from @storybook/testing-react
import { expect } from '@storybook/testing-react';

// Create a custom card component using the BEM classes and Bulma components
const CustomCard = ({ image, title, text }) => {
  return (
    <Card className="card">
      <Card.Image className="card__image" src={image} />
      <Card.Content className="card__content">
        <Content>
          <Heading className="card__title" size={4}>
            {title}
          </Heading>
          <p className="card__text">{text}</p>
        </Content>
      </Card.Content>
    </Card>
  );
};

// Export the component name as default
export default {
  title: 'CustomCard',
  component: CustomCard,
};

// Export some stories for the component with different props
export const Default = () => (
  <CustomCard
    image="https://source.unsplash.com/random"
    title="Default Card"
    text="This is a default card with no custom props."
  />
);

// Add some assertions to check the default story
Default.play = async ({ getByRole }) => {
  // Check that the card has an image with the correct src attribute
  expect(getByRole('img')).toHaveAttribute('src', 'https://source.unsplash.com/random');

  // Check that the card has a heading with the correct text content
  expect(getByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent('Default Card');

  // Check that the card has a paragraph with the correct text content
  expect(getByRole('paragraph')).toHaveTextContent('This is a default card with no custom props.');
};

export const Large = () => (
  <CustomCard
    image="https://source.unsplash.com/random"
    title="Large Card"
    text="This is a large card with a custom style prop."
    style={{ width: '24rem' }}
  />
);

// Add some assertions to check the large story
Large.play = async ({ getByRole }) => {
  // Check that the card has an image with the correct src attribute
  expect(getByRole('img')).toHaveAttribute('src', 'https://source.unsplash.com/random');

  // Check that the card has a heading with the correct text content
  expect(getByRole('heading')).toHaveTextContent('Large Card');

  // Check that the card has a paragraph with the correct text content
  expect(getByRole('paragraph')).toHaveTextContent('This is a large card with a custom style prop.');

  // Check that the card has a custom width style
  expect(getByRole('article')).toHaveStyle({ width: '24rem' });
};

export const Small = () => (
  <CustomCard
    image="https://source.unsplash.com/random"
    title="Small Card"
    text="This is a small card with a custom style prop."
    style={{ width: '12rem' }}
  />
);

// Add some assertions to check the small story
Small.play = async ({ getByRole }) => {
  // Check that the card has an image with the correct src attribute
  expect(getByRole('img')).toHaveAttribute('src', 'https://source.unsplash.com/random');

  // Check that the card has a heading with the correct text content

Can you show me how to use visual tests or accessibility tests?

----

Searching for: storybook visual tests accessibility tests

Sure, here is how you can use visual tests or accessibility tests with Storybook.

Visual tests capture a screenshot of every story and compare it against a baseline image to detect any changes in appearance. This can help you catch UI bugs such as layout issues, color inconsistencies, or missing elements. To use visual tests, you need to install an addon such as Storybook Chromatic¹ or Storybook Screenshot². These addons integrate with cloud services that run visual tests for your stories and generate reports.

Accessibility tests check your stories for any violations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) or other best practices for making your UI accessible to all users. This can help you catch usability issues such as low contrast, missing labels, keyboard traps, or invalid HTML. To use accessibility tests, you need to install the Storybook Accessibility addon³. This addon runs the Axe library on your stories and displays the results in a panel. You can also use the addon to simulate different vision defects such as protanopia or deuteranomaly.

For example, you could install the Storybook Accessibility addon by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @storybook/addon-a11y
```

Then, you need to add '@storybook/addon-a11y' to the addons array in your .storybook/main.js file:

```js
module.exports = {
  stories: ['../src/**/*.stories.js'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-a11y'],
};
```

Now, you can see the accessibility panel in your Storybook UI. You can use it to run an audit on your stories and see any accessibility issues. You can also use it to toggle different vision defects and see how your UI looks for users with different visual impairments.

Can we package our custom component and publish it with the "bit" toolchain? (official site at https://bit.dev/ )

----

Searching for: bit.dev react component

Sure, here is how you can package your custom component and publish it with the Bit toolchain¹. I followed the steps from the official documentation² to install and configure Bit for React components.

First, you need to install Bit as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @teambit/bvm
```

Then, you need to initialize Bit in your project:

```bash
npx bbit init
```

This will create a .bitmap file that tracks your components and a .bit folder that contains Bit configuration files.

Next, you need to add your custom component to Bit:

```bash
npx bbit add src/CustomCard.js --namespace ui
```

This will add your CustomCard component to the ui namespace and assign it a unique ID. You can also specify other options such as tests, dependencies, or main file.

Next, you need to tag your component with a version number:

```bash
npx bbit tag ui/custom-card 1.0.0
```

This will create a snapshot of your component with the specified version number. You can also use semantic versioning or omit the version number to let Bit auto-increment it.

Next, you need to export your component to a remote scope:

```bash
npx bbit export username.ui/custom-card
```

This will export your component to a remote scope hosted on bit.dev under your username. You can also use other hosting options such as GitHub or self-hosted servers.

Now, you have successfully packaged and published your custom component with Bit. You can view it on bit.dev or import it in other projects using Bit or npm.

Can you show me how to use Bit with Storybook?

----

Searching for: bit.dev storybook

Sure, here is how you can use Bit with Storybook¹. I followed the steps from the official documentation² to install and configure Bit for Storybook components.

First, you need to install Bit as a dev dependency in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @teambit/bvm
```

Then, you need to initialize Bit in your project:

```bash
npx bbit init
```

This will create a .bitmap file that tracks your components and a .bit folder that contains Bit configuration files.

Next, you need to install the Bit React environment and the Bit Storybook extension:

```bash
npx bbit import @teambit/react --type env
npx bbit import @teambit/storybook --type env
```

This will add the React environment and the Storybook extension to your .bit folder.

Next, you need to configure Bit to use the Storybook extension for your components. You can do this by adding a variants property to your workspace.jsonc file:

```json
{
  "teambit.workspace/workspace": {
    "name": "my-workspace",
    "icon": "https://static.bit.dev/bit-logo.svg",
    "defaultScope": "username.ui"
  },
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm"
  },
  "teambit.react/react": {},
  "teambit.storybook/storybook": {},
  "variants": {
    "{ui/**}": {
      "teambit.react/react": {},
      "teambit.storybook/storybook": {}
    }
  }
}
```

This will tell Bit to apply the React environment and the Storybook extension to any component under the ui namespace.

Next, you need to add your custom component and its stories to Bit:

```bash
npx bbit add src/CustomCard.js --namespace ui
npx bbit add src/CustomCard.stories.js --id ui/custom-card
```

This will add your CustomCard component and its stories file to the ui namespace and assign them a unique ID.

Next, you need to tag your component with a version number:

```bash
npx bbit tag ui/custom-card 1.0.0
```

This will create a snapshot of your component with the specified version number. You can also use semantic versioning or omit the version number to let Bit auto-increment it.

Next, you need to export your component to a remote scope:

```bash
npx bbit export username.ui/custom-card
```

This will export your component and its stories to a remote scope hosted on bit.dev under your username. You can also use other hosting options such as GitHub or self-hosted servers.

Now, you have successfully used Bit with Storybook. You can view your component and its stories on bit.dev or import them in other projects using Bit or npm.
